        are done through Unity3D. In regards to my JavaScript games my frogger one was done with the assistance of Zenva Academy while the dodging enemies game was made through my own initiative with very 
        little assistance from anyone. My future plans once I learn the various JavaScript frameworks would be to learn Phaser.`
