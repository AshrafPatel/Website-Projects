//Originally used for canvas starfield simulator

//had a class for images
//had x and  y position set to random
//height and width was also set
//and a third position z which expands from center to grow bigger

//had an array of images but couldnt import it to canvas and became stuck so this project was dropped
//also draw method was also not working correctly so couldn't get basic animation to work the end result was this project was scrapped
